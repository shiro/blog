Solid Start is rapidly progressing toward the initial 1.0 stable release, so let's look
at how we can build a pre-rendered page and deploy it to Github pages.

[Github pages](https://pages.github.com) is a great (and free) place to host static sites
such as blog and portfolio websites.
While there's plenty of documentation how to build and deploy a React app there, consider
using a superior framework like Solid.js, built with
[Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com/) - the official meta-framework
for building and deploying apps quickly.

# Creating a Github repository

The first step is creating a new Github repository, for this example I'll be calling
mine `my-blog`.
Next we need to configure Github pages, navigate to the `Settings > Pages` tab
and set the `Source` to `Github Actions` so that our page gets build and deployed
automatically through the CI.

Optionally it's also possible to configure the app to run with a custom domain name.
There's plenty of documentation on how to do so, but I'll be sticking with the defaults
for this article. Regardless, the rest of the configuration won't change much.


# Creating a Solid Start app

Follow the [offictial documentation](start.solidjs.com) to setup a new app, it's as simple
as running a single command and selecting the presets you want.
I'll be using the `basic` template, which comes with a simple landing page, a router
and some simple client components to make sure things are working.


```terminal
[shiro@shiro-pc:~]# pnpm create solid
   Create-Solid v0.5.8
â”‚
â—‡ Project Name
â”‚  my-blog
â”‚
â—‡ Is this a Solid-Start project?
â”‚  Yes
â”‚
â—‡ Which template would you like to use?
â”‚  basic
â”‚
â—‡ Use Typescript?
â”‚  Yes
â”‚
â—‡ Project successfully created! ðŸŽ‰
â”‚
â—‡ To get started, run: â”€â•®
â”‚                        â”‚
â”‚  cd my-blog            â”‚
â”‚  pnpm install          â”‚
â”‚  pnpm dev              â”‚
â”‚                        â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•¯
[shiro@shiro-pc:~]# cd my-blog
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# pnpm install
Done in 23.3s
```

Since we don't really have a server for our backend (Github pages just serves
static assets), we need to update the configuration, so that the output will be a
pre-rendered static site with client side interactivity.
If you need to display dynamic content that isn't known at compile-time, you
might want to consider adding an external API server and loading the dynamic
data from the client after page load.

```tsx title="app.config.ts" diff
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
+  server: {
+    baseURL: process.env.BASE_PATH,
+    static: true,
+    prerender: {
+      failOnError: true,
+      routes: ["/"],
+      crawlLinks: true,
+    },
+  },
});
```
It's also necessary to let the router know where the URL root of the site is, i.e. in
the case of Github pages, it'll be the respository name, which we can inject as an
environmental variable at build-time.

```tsx title="src/app.tsx" diff
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router
+      base={import.meta.env.SERVER_BASE_URL}
      root={(props) => (...)}
    >
      <FileRoutes />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

With this, our router should now behave as expected.
Let's add the Github Actions configuration so that our site will be built whenever
a new commit is made to the `master` branch.
You can customize the workflow in many ways, as described in the
[docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

```yaml title=".github/workflows/CI.yml"
name: Build package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
    tags: [ '*' ]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: latest

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.12.0'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: install
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: build
        run: pnpm build
        env:
          BASE_PATH: '/my-blog'

      - name: upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3.0.1
        with:
          path: '.output/public'

  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4.0.5
```

While the configuration might look complicated, it's easy to look at individual steps
and understand what they do. It's mostly about setting up the environment, install dependencies
and finally build and deploy our app.
Since the code is already hosted on Github, there's no need to pass in any secrets for deployment
authorization, pretty convenient indeed.

The last step is to initialize the git repository in our codebase and push it to Github.

```terminal
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/my-blog/.git/
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-blog.git
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git add .
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git commit -m "Initial commit"
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git push
To github.com:username/my-blog.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

Once the code is committed, you can visit the `Actions` tab in the Github repository
UI and ensure the new workflow is being run.

# Test it out

If everything went as expected, you should now see the new workflow run being successful
after a couple of seconds. This means the static site is now deployed at
`https://username.github.io/my-blog`

Let's try opening the page and ensuring everything works as it should.
Also check for any errors in the console and try clicking the button to increase the counter.
If the counter works, it means that JS hydrated successfully and client side Javascript works
as expected.

With this you should have a basic Solid Start app that auto-builds and deploys
itself on new commits. If you're interested in a more complex site that uses
the same base configuration we just built, check out the repository for my
blog site.

With services like Github actions making building and deploying sites free and
easy, there's no limit to what we can build, let your imagination run wild!
