Shiki is a great library for adding some color to markdown codeblocks, so let's add some
awesome diff highlighting to it.


For anyone unaware, [Shiki](https://shiki.style) is a neat little library that adds
syntax highlihgting to your code blocks in markdown. There's a [wide list of languages
supported](https://shiki.style/languages) as well as support for adding
custom languages.
The installation process is very quick and supports various markdown environments
such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which I'll be using today.

# The quest for existing solutions

## Github

First, let's look at how *not* to do diff highlighting - by looking at what Github
does. At the time of writing, Github does not support syntax highlighting
of languages in conjunction with diff highlighting - it's either one or the other.
This means that, if you want to show any sort of diff highlighting, you loose all
other syntax highlighting.

Yeah... doesn't look that great (in my opinion).
Another big issue is, that selecting text also selects the diff `+` and `-` markers,
which is very annoying since the markers need to be manually removed when pasted
into an editor.

Let's look at how the markup looks like:

````txt
```diff
-console.log('hewwo')
+console.log('hello')
console.log('goodbye')
```
````

Alright, at least the markup looks pretty good in my opinion - simple and easy to understand, just
add a `+` or `-` as the first character in a line and it gets highlighted!

## Shiki/transformers

Lucky for us, there seems to be a first-party plugin for adding all sorts of notions, including
diff highlighting! I highly encourage everyone to look at the awesome
[@shiki/transformers](https://shiki.style/packages/transformers#transformernotationdiff)
package which seems to have just what we need, and it's just 1 line to add the plugin.

Here's the example output from the documentation:

<Img
src={p2}
thumbnail={t2}
caption="Shiki diff transformer"
/>

It looks great, doesn't select the marker symbols, and it's not opinionated about the styling -
lines just get some CSS classes assigned and we can style them however we want, neat!  
Now let's look at the markup:

````txt
```ts
console.log('hewwo') // [!code --]
console.log('hello') // [!code ++]
console.log('goodbye')
```
````

Ok... I have to say it's not exactly my cup of tea. The same parsing logic is used for all sorts
of notations the package supports, so it makes sense for it to be more complex so that it supports
passing in additional arguments, etc. but it's a bit overkill for our use-case.

Most people would just accept the notation and carry on with their day, but if you're like me,
follow along as we make our own implementation.

# A better notation

I decided to work off the existing code and just change the necessary parts, so the first step
was to copy the [original
implementation](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/packages/transformers/src/transformers/notation-diff.ts) and
it's dependencies.
The next step was to decide on a notation, the Github one seems pretty good so I'll go with that.

````txt
```ts diff
-console.log('hewwo')
+console.log('hello')
console.log('goodbye')
```
````


Implementing a shiki highlighter is incredibly easy, since the library provides all the hooks
we need and more - there's even helpers for adding CSS classes to nodes.
Here's what a simple implementation of the above looks like:

```ts title="shikiDiffNotation.ts"
export function shikiDiffNotation(
  options: shikiDiffNotationOptions = {}
): ShikiTransformer {
  const {
    classLineAdd = "add",
    classLineRemove = "remove",
    classActivePre = "diff",
  } = options;

  return {
    name: "shiki-diff-notation",
    code(node: MetaNode) {
      if (!node.meta?.diff) return;
      this.addClassToHast(this.pre, classActivePre);

      const lines = node.children.filter(
        (node) => node.type === "element"
      ) as Element[];

      lines.forEach((line) => {
        for (const child of line.children) {
          if (child.type !== "element") continue;
          const text = child.children[0];
          if (text.type !== "text") continue;

          if (text.value.startsWith("+")) {
            text.value = text.value.slice(1);
            this.addClassToHast(line, classLineAdd);
          }
          if (text.value.startsWith("-")) {
            text.value = text.value.slice(1);
            this.addClassToHast(line, classLineRemove);
          }
        }
      });
    },
  };
}
```

I also added a couple of CSS classes to add highlighting and marker symbols that
won't get included in user selections.
After adding our plugin, we can now enjoy the new, superior, notation as it
was originally intended:

```ts diff
-console.log('hewwo')
+console.log('hello')
console.log('goodbye')
```

Perfection.
