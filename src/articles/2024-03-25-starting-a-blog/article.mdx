# Staring a blog!

Since everyone and their dog likes to post about cool new tech on their blog I decided to try it out.

I'll mostly write about frameworks, libraries and how to make lots of moving parts work together.
For starts I'm planning to do some articles about building static sites like this blog, using
[Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/s) - an amazing framework that will be more popular than React someday (maybe).

All code is available [gitHub](https://github.com/shiro/blog), feel free to check it out.

Some other topics I intend to cover:
- Solid Start development progress
- Rust, wasm and wgpu
- Keyboard input remapping and macros
- NixOS guides, tips and tricks
- System automation and backups
- Photography on Linux

And lots of other topics that are worth discussing!
