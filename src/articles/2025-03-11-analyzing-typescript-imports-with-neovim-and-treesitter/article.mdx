title: Analyzing typescript imports with neovim and treesitter
---

Ever wanted to do automate a task that requires looking at typescript imports and doing something boring and repetitive
with them?
Neovim offers tooling to do that, and more, out of the box!

There's many use-cases for scanning over parts of the code and automating tasks, but chances are you can imagine at
least a few that would improve your workflow when writing code.
That recently happened to me, when I couldn't find a way to copy imports automatically when copying typescript code
between files (but that's a story for next time).

Neovim uses treesitter for code highlighting, but that's not all it can be used for. Treesitter builds an AST over code
tokens, but instead of using that for highlighting, we'll extract some information from it.


We can inspect the tree by running:

```text
:InspectTree
```

The output depends on the filetype and its contents. For a typescript file, the beginning might look something like: 

```ansi
(program ; [0, 0] - [342, 0]
  (import_statement ; [0, 0] - [0, 77]
    (import_clause ; [0, 7] - [0, 27]
      (named_imports ; [0, 7] - [0, 27]
        (import_specifier ; [0, 9] - [0, 25]
          name: (identifier)))) ; [0, 9] - [0, 25]

[more nodes...]
```

Which is exactly what we were looking for. It breaks down parts of the code into smaller and smaller tokens and gives
us the row/column ranges for each token.

Nodes can then be queried using the treesitter query language. After running the query we can back the matched nodes.


```lua
local import_query = "((import_statement) @node)"
local bufnr = 0

local language_tree = vim.treesitter.get_parser(bufnr)
local root = language_tree:trees()[1]:root()

local query = vim.treesitter.query.parse(language_tree:lang(), import_query)
if query == nil then return end

for _, node in query:iter_captures(root, bufnr) do
    -- do something with node
end
```

And that's all there's to it! As long as we know the structure of the AST, parsing out the info we need is pretty
trivial. Do mind that there are several possible ways to import things in typescript:
- named (`import {foo} from "bar"`)
- named with alias (`import {foo as moo} from "bar"`)
- namespace (`import * as foo from "bar"`)
- default (`import foo from "bar"`)
- ambient (`import "bar"`)

We need to write code defensively to breaking our code logic throwing an error.

There's also a handy utility method to get the text at a node range:

```lua
if node:type() == "named_imports" then
    local text = vim.treesitter.get_node_text(node, bufnr)

    local first_child = node.child(0)
    local child_text = vim.treesitter.get_node_text(first_child, bufnr)
end
```

Treesitter knows how to deal with most languages, so there's virtually no limit to what we can use scripting for (i.e.
we could find all variable declarations in a python file, all global function names in a go file, etc.).

Next time we'll write a small plugin that uses treesitter info to do something useful!
