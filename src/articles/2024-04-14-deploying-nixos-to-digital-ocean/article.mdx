NixOS is not a currently supported Linux distribution on Digital Ocean, but that
won't stop us from deploying it there.


# Introduction

[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) is a popular cloud hosting provider for Linux servers,
databases and much more. When it comes to choosing a Linux distribution for your server,
there are many things to consider such as package format, update/upgrade cycles, maintenance overhead, etc.

[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is not just a great disto for desktop use, but has lots of features
that make it a good choice for servers as well, such as declarative configuration of the entire
system, reproducability and reliability.
I personally started using it for production servers a about year ago and never looked back,
giving it a try is highly recommended!

Spinning up a NixOS droplet takes only around 5 minutes and is a great way to try it out
without any commitment or time/cost investment.


# Creating a droplet

Droplets are basically virtual Linux servers that we can SSH into and manage ourselves.
Let's create a new one and make it run NixOS.  

Select `Manage > Droplets` from the navigation sidebar and click the big `Create Droplet`
button.
As for the droplet region, simply select one close to you.
The next step is selecting which Linux distribution we want, however as you might have noticed,
NixOS is currently not officially supported.

Thankfully, there's a cool project called [NixOS Infect](https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect)
that allows us to convert an existing live Linux install to a NixOS system on the fly.
I recommend going to the project's Github page and
checking which image is confirmed to be working from the table.

At the time of writing, `Ubuntu 22.04 x64` seemed to be working and was available on DO, so that's
what I selected.
I don't think the distro matters in this case, since it will get converted to NixOS anyways.

| Distribution | Name      | Status  | Test date  |
| :----------- | :-------- | :------ | :--------- |
| ...          | ...       | ...     | ...        |
| Ubuntu       | 20.04 x64 | success | 2022-03-23 |
| Ubuntu       | 22.04 x64 | success | 2023-06-05 |
| Ubuntu       | 22.10 x64 | failure | 2023-06-05 |
| Ubuntu       | 23.10 x64 | failure | 2023-11-16 |
| ...          | ...       | ...     | ...        |

Table: Select a tested distro from the list.

After selecting the image, I'll select the 6$/mo droplet and upload my SSH public key to
login with ease. If you're not familiar with SSH keys, I recommend [reading up on them](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys) or using the password login.

Click `Advanced Options > Add Initialization scripts (free)` and paste in the code from the NixOS infect documentation:

```txt
#cloud-config

runcmd:
  - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect | PROVIDER=digitalocean NIX_CHANNEL=nixos-23.05 bash 2>&1 | tee /tmp/infect.log
```

The above is an init script that will run NixOS infect as soon as the droplet is initialized.
Finally, it's time to hit that big `Create Droplet` button.
After a few seconds you should see the droplet running and ready on the dashboard.

## Configuring the system

Once the droplet is created, click on the `IPv4` field to copy the address to the system clipboard, open
a terminal and connect to the droplet. After connecting, ensure it worked by checking the system info.

```txt
[shiro@pc:~]# ssh root@143.198.219.81
[root@droplet:~]# uname -a
Linux droplet 6.1.69 #1-NixOS SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Dec 20 16:00:29 UTC 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

If it says `NixOS` instead of `Ubuntu` like the above, you are now running a NixOS system!  
Let's try adding some packages by rebuilding the system, since there's currently
no installed editor, we'll drop into a nix-shell.


```txt
[root@droplet:~]# cd /etc/nixos/
[root@droplet:/etc/nixos]# nix-shell -p neovim
[nix-shell:/etc/nixos]# nvim configuration.nix
```

```nix diff title="/etc/nixos/configuration.nix"
+{ pkgs, ... }: {
  imports = [
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ./networking.nix # generated at runtime by nixos-infect
  ];

+  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ neovim cowsay ];

  # ... rest of the config file
}
```

After saving the file and closing the editor, all that's left to do is
rebuilding the system and switching to the new version that includes
the new packages we specified.
After switching, the packages should be available as globally installed
system packages.

```txt
[nix-shell:/etc/nixos]# exit
[root@droplet:~]# nixos-rebuild switch
[root@droplet:~]# echo "NixOS in the cloud!" | cowsay
 _____________________

```

Congratulations, now you can further customize you system and levarage the full power of NixOS in the
cloud.
