Recent MacBook models with the M1/M2 chips show amazing performance and are popular among developers,
however Apple refuses to officially support other operating systems.
Today we will install NixOS on it and see how well it works!

Since there is no official support for Linux, the only reason it's even possible to do is the
amazing community, which developed lots of tools, kernel patches, drivers and more!  
Most of the development effort is centralized around the [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org)
project, and I highly recommend you help them out financially or in other ways, if possible.

Officially, Asahi ships Fedora, however there's also a community around running Asahi with
NixOS, which is what we'll be looking at doing today.

# Before starting

First, it's important to check what is currently supported with your hardware, and luckily
the Asahi Linux wiki provides all supported features in an easy to understand way.
I'm currently working with an M2 MacBook Pro (2023) model, so I'll be looking at the
[M2 Series Feature Support](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/M2-Series-Feature-Support) page.
There's also similar pages for other models.

At the time of writing, several features are missing for my specific model:
- GPU acceleration
- Video Decoder support
- Thunderbolt
- DP Alt Mode (used to connect external monitors)
- internal microphone

If any of that is a deal-breaker, you might want to wait until it gets implemented.  
We'll have to keep the original MacOS partition in tact regardless, since that's currently the only way
to update the firmware, meaning you can dual-boot and play around with Linux even if it lacks some features.

Installing NixOS is surprisingly easy, and mostly just means following the nicely written instructions.
I'll be using the [instructions (UEFI Boot Standalone NixOS
2024-05-23)](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon/blob/842306255856d7f5677c113e699101eb253e2e3f/docs/uefi-standalone.md),
which is the up-to-date way of doing it at the time of writing. Make sure to follow the latest
version of the document since some steps might change in the future.


# Prepeartion

Let's prepare everything we need to install NixOS.

It is recommended to upgrade MacOS to the latest available version, since some features won't
work otherwise. We'll also need access to an administrator account and some free disk space (at least 50Gb).

We'll also need to flash the installation image onto a USB drive. You can build it yourself, but
it's easier to just download a [pre-built image](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon/releases) and
flashing it using:

```ansi terminal
[shiro@shiro-pc:~]# lsblk
# find your USB device (for me it's /dev/sdb)
[shiro@shiro-pc:~]# cat macos-nixos.iso > /dev/sdb
```

Note that even though Thunderbolt is not supported by Asahi at the time of writing, my Thunderbold-based
USB hub worked fine for booting the USB key (but wasn't usable in Linux).

Now we're ready to move on to the actual installation.

# Installing NixOS

It is important to follow the latest up-to-date instructions, I'll just be sharing my experience at the
time of writing, but the steps might change in the future!

First I installed the bootloader by opening a terminal in MacOS and runnning:

```ansi terminal
[shiro@shiro-macos:~]# curl https://alx.sh | sh
# follow the interactive instructions
```

I resized the MacOS partition to 50Gb and used the rest for NixOS. After confirming everything, the
machine shuts down. After that I had to start the machine by holding the power button for several seconds
and inputing my admin password twice.

With the bootloader ready, the machine should automatically boot from the USB stick when it's inserted,
the rest is a straightforward NixOS install as per ususal.
I opted for a simple `ext4` partition setup, but would like to try BTRFS and LUKS encryption in the future as well.
Since there's no real difference compared to installing NixOS to any other machine, I won't go into
too much detail here, but there's detailed info in the instructions.

After installing NixOS, the machine should boot into it by default (when no USB is inserted), so all that's
left is customizing the new system.

The first step is creating a new Github repository, for this example I'll be calling
mine `my-blog`.
Next we need to configure Github pages, navigate to the `Settings > Pages` tab
and set the `Source` to `Github Actions` so that our page gets build and deployed
automatically through the CI.

caption="We need to set the source to Github actions"
/>

Optionally it's also possible to configure the app to run with a custom domain name.
There's plenty of documentation on how to do so, but I'll be sticking with the defaults
for this article. Regardless, the rest of the configuration won't change much.


```ansi terminal
[shiro@shiro-pc:~]# echo wow
```

Since we don't really have a server for our backend (Github pages just serves
static assets), we need to update the configuration, so that the output will be a
pre-rendered static site with client side interactivity.
If you need to display dynamic content that isn't known at compile-time, you
might want to consider adding an external API server and loading the dynamic
data from the client after page load.

```tsx title="app.config.ts" diff
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
+  server: {
+    baseURL: process.env.BASE_PATH,
+    static: true,
+    prerender: {
+      failOnError: true,
+      routes: ["/"],
+      crawlLinks: true,
+    },
+  },
});
```
It's also necessary to let the router know where the URL root of the site is, i.e. in
the case of Github pages, it'll be the respository name, which we can inject as an
environmental variable at build-time.

```tsx title="src/app.tsx" diff
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router
+      base={import.meta.env.SERVER_BASE_URL}
      root={(props) => (...)}
    >
      <FileRoutes />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

With this, our router should now behave as expected.
Let's add the Github Actions configuration so that our site will be built whenever
a new commit is made to the `master` branch.
You can customize the workflow in many ways, as described in the
[docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

```yaml title=".github/workflows/CI.yml"
name: Build package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
    tags: [ '*' ]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: latest

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.12.0'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: install
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: build
        run: pnpm build
        env:
          BASE_PATH: '/my-blog'

      - name: upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3.0.1
        with:
          path: '.output/public'

  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4.0.5
```

While the configuration might look complicated, it's easy to look at individual steps
and understand what they do. It's mostly about setting up the environment, install dependencies
and finally build and deploy our app.
Since the code is already hosted on Github, there's no need to pass in any secrets for deployment
authorization, pretty convenient indeed.

The last step is to initialize the git repository in our codebase and push it to Github.

```ansi terminal
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/my-blog/.git/
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-blog.git
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git add .
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git commit -m "Initial commit"
[shiro@shiro-pc:~/my-blog]# git push
To github.com:username/my-blog.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

Once the code is committed, you can visit the `Actions` tab in the Github repository
UI and ensure the new workflow is being run.

# Test it out

If everything went as expected, you should now see the new workflow run being successful
after a couple of seconds. This means the static site is now deployed at
`https://username.github.io/my-blog`

<Img

thumbnail={t2}
caption="The workflow finished successfully"
/>

Let's try opening the page and ensuring everything works as it should.
Also check for any errors in the console and try clicking the button to increase the counter.
If the counter works, it means that JS hydrated successfully and client side Javascript works
as expected.

With this you should have a basic Solid Start app that auto-builds and deploys
itself on new commits. If you're interested in a more complex site that uses
the same base configuration we just built, check out the repository for my
blog site.

With services like Github actions making building and deploying sites free and
easy, there's no limit to what we can build, let your imagination run wild!
