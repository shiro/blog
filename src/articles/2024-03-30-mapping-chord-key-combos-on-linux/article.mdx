# Mapping chord key combos on Linux

Recently I realized that lots of my key combinations require pretty unhealthy hand movements, so
I added chording key combos to my life.

Chording combos refer to pressing multiple keys at the same time (or in very quick succession) to
trigger some action rather that outputing the keys. The keys still function normally when not
pressed in a chord.

While I'm not exactly sure if chording is the official name for it, I've been using this
cool [vim plugin](https://github.com/kana/vim-arpeggio) that calls it that, so that's how I'm going to refer to it.

Since I developed my own software for Linux key remapping a while ago (I'll talk about it in length another time), adding the functionality there seemed like the obvious way to go.
The project is called map2 and allows for blazingly fast key-remapping and even allows
running arbirary python code to achieve even the craziest ideas.

Something similar might be doable on Windows using AutoHotkey as well.

After setting the end-goal, I started writing some quick prototype code in Python.
The idea is simple:
- define some key-combos in an array
- bind a custom python callback on all keys that appear as chord inputs
- once a chord-key is hit, set a timeout which delays the event
- if another key is pressed, clear the timeoout and, if it completes a chord, remap it

Of course I knew from the get-go that the above is just the ideal path, there's lots of edge
cases to handle here.

Here's my initial prototype code that mostly works but doesn't cover all edge cases
(it's supposed to work, not look good):

<Spoiler>
```python title="arpeggio.py"
combos = {
    frozenset({"a", "b"}): "c",
    frozenset({"a", "d"}): "e",
}

chord_chars = set([x for y in combos for x in y])
interval = None
stack = []

def arpeggio(mapper, writer):
  is_down = {}
  def fn(key, state):
    global chord_chars, interval, stack
    nonlocal is_down

    if key not in chord_chars:
      if interval is not None:
        interval.cancel()
        interval = None

      pressed = [k for k in is_down if is_down[k]]
      if pressed != []:
        writer.send("".join(map(lambda k: "{"+k+" up}", pressed)))

      if len(stack) > 0:
        writer.send("".join(stack))
        stack = []

      is_down = {}
      return True

    if state == "down":
      stack = stack + [key]

      def submit():
        global interval, combos, stack
        nonlocal is_down

        if interval is not None:
          interval.cancel()
          interval = None

        output = combos.get(frozenset(stack), None)
        if output is not None:
          writer.send(output)
          stack = []
        else:
          if stack == [key]:
            is_down[key] = True
            stack = []
            writer.send("{"+key+" down}")
          elif len(stack) == 2:
            writer.send("".join(stack))
            stack = []

      if len(stack) == 2:
        submit()
      elif interval is None:
        interval = setInterval(50, submit)

    if state == "repeat":
      if is_down.get(key):
        writer.send("{"+key+" repeat}")

    if state == "up":
      if interval is not None:
        interval.cancel()
        interval = None

      if is_down.get(key):
        if stack != []:
          writer.send("".join(stack))
          stack = []

        is_down[key] = False
        stack = []
        return True


      if stack != []:
        writer.send("".join(stack))
        stack = []

  mapper.map_fallback(fn)
```

The Python prototype was a good first step and reassured me that using chords is the way
to go - it just feels nice and reduces finger travel time by a lot.

I could have ended it there, but since this seemed like something lots of people could
benefit from, I decided to do a native implementation and support it as part of the
core map2 API. After a fun weekend, I managed to hack together someting I was satisfied
with, here's the final API:


```python  title="example.py"
import map2

# capture keyboard inputs with a reader
reader = map2.Reader(patterns=["/dev/input/by-id/your-kbd"])
# re-map them using a chrod mapper
mapper = map2.ChordMapper()
# and write them to a virtual device
writer = map2.Writer(clone_from="/dev/input/by-id/your-kbd")
# setup the event pipeline
map2.link([reader, mapper, writer])

# and map some chords!
mapper_kbd_arp.map([";", "a"], "A")
mapper_kbd_arp.map([";", "s"], "S")
mapper_kbd_arp.map([";", "d"], "D")
mapper_kbd_arp.map([";", "f"], "F")
mapper_kbd_arp.map([";", "g"], "G")
# and so on...
```

Curently we only support 2-key-chords, I also decided to write the code in a way
that allows for future multi-key support.

Since map2 has a pretty nice e2e test harness, it was also possible to test lots
of edge cases systematically, getting me to a working version without ever
running the script on my keyboard - this was one of those rare movements where
test-driven-development actually worked well!  
Here's a sample:

```rust title="examples/tests/chords.rs"
#[pyo3_asyncio::tokio::test]
async fn simple_chord() -> PyResult<()> {
    Python::with_gil(|py| -> PyResult<()> {
        let m = pytests::include_python!();

        reader_send_all(py, m, "reader", &keys("{a down}{b down}{a up}{b up}"));
        sleep(py, 55);
        assert_eq!(writer_read_all(py, m, "writer"), keys("c"),);
        sleep(py, 55);
        assert_empty!(py, m, WRITER);

        Ok(())
    })?;
    Ok(())
}
```

At the momemt of writing this, the API is not documented in the docs since I decided
to use it for a month before doing that.
