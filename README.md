## Known issues

### Pre-transform error: ENOENT

On the first run there's often issues with vite optimised files missing, such as:

```
10:43:53 AM [vite] Pre-transform error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/project/node_modules/.vinxi/client/deps/classnames.js' (x2)
...
```

This is a known linaria bug, it's being tracked [here](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/14493).
The workaround is to type `r<ENTER>` into the terminal which will restart the vinxi server.
